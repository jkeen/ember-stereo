This means that between when this addon emits a new `addon/index.js` for a particular app and when that file actually gets consumed by that app's build, it can get overwritten by the `addon/index.js` for a different app, resulting in a broken import in the final build.\r\n\r\nThis change switches over to emitting the generated `index.js` directly into ember-get-config's broccoli tree, rather than mutating the source in place.","closed_by":{"login":"briarsweetbriar","id":2700872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDA4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2700872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/briarsweetbriar","html_url":"https://github.com/briarsweetbriar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briarsweetbriar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briarsweetbriar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briarsweetbriar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briarsweetbriar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briarsweetbriar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briarsweetbriar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briarsweetbriar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briarsweetbriar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briarsweetbriar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mansona/ember-get-config/issues/13/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mansona/ember-get-config/issues/13/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null}
